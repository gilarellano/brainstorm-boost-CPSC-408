### client/
This directory encompasses the entire front-end of the application. It's built using JavaScript and includes all necessary files and subdirectories for the front-end functionality.
- `node_modules/`: This directory houses the Node.js modules installed via npm, which are necessary for running and building the front-end.
- `package-lock.json`: This file is automatically generated for any operations where npm modifies either the node_modules directory or package.json. It describes the exact tree that was generated to ensure that subsequent installs are able to generate identical trees, regardless of intermediate dependency updates.
- `package.json`: This file holds various metadata relevant to the project, including its dependencies, scripts, version, and more.
- `public/`: This directory contains static files that are not manipulated by JavaScript code and can be directly sent to the client.
- `src/`: This directory contains the application's source code files.

### server/
This directory contains all the back-end files, written in Python using the Flask framework. While it does not yet have a connected database, it does include several files necessary for server-side operations and business logic.
- `Generator.py, Group.py, Idea.py, Member.py, VotingSystem.py`: These files contain the definitions and logic for their respective classes, representing different components of the application.
- `db/`: This directory is intended for the application's database files but is currently empty.
- `flask_session/`: This directory is used to store session files for the Flask application.
- `server.py`: This is the main server-side script that starts and manages the Flask application.
- `venv/`: This directory contains the Python virtual environment files, ensuring the project's dependencies are isolated from other Python projects on the same machine.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BrainstormBoost.git
```
2. Create a virtual environment and activate it.
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
3. Install the required packages from requirements.txt.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Set up your MySQL database and update config.py with your database credentials.
5. Run the database migrations.
```bash
flask db upgrade
```
6. Set the required environment variables for Flask and the OpenAI API key.
```bash
export FLASK_APP=app.py
export FLASK_ENV=development
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```
7. Start the Flask development server.
```bash
flask run
```
Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to access the BrainstormBoost application.

## Usage
On the homepage, click "Create Group" to create a new group.
Add members to the group by clicking "Add Member" and entering the member's information, including their skills and interests.
Once you have added all the members, click "Generate Ideas" to request project ideas from the OpenAI API.
The generated ideas will be displayed along with a voting interface. Each member can rank their top three ideas by assigning points (3 for their top choice, 2 for their second choice, and 1 for their third choice).
After the members have cast their votes, the application will display the winning idea.
You can create additional groups and follow the same process to generate and vote on project ideas.
