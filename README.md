# BrainstormBoost
BrainstormBoost is a web application designed to help student groups generate project ideas based on the members' skills and interests. Utilizing OpenAI's API, the application suggests personalized project ideas that cater to the strengths of each group member. This project incorporates a MySQL database to store group, member, and idea information, and is built with Flask for a seamless user experience.

## Features
Group and member management: Create and edit groups with member profiles, including skills and interests.
Idea generation: Automatically generate a list of 5 project ideas based on the skills and interests of the group members.
Voting system: Rank and vote on generated ideas to select the most suitable project for the group.
Database-driven: Built on MySQL, the application securely stores group, member, idea, and voting data.
Web-based UI: Easy-to-use, responsive web interface for convenient access and interaction.

## Usage
On the homepage, click "Create Group" to create a new group.

Add members to the group by clicking "Add Member" and entering the member's information, including their skills and interests.

Once you have added all the members, click "Generate Ideas" to request project ideas from the OpenAI API.

The generated ideas will be displayed along with a voting interface. Each member can rank their top three ideas by assigning points (3 for their top choice, 2 for their second choice, and 1 for their third choice).

After the members have cast their votes, the application will display the winning idea.

You can create additional groups and follow the same process to generate and vote on project ideas.
